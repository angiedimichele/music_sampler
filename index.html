<div class="his-story">
<p>Elliott Smith started his life on Aug. 6, 1969 in Omaha, Nebraska. Then, he was called Steven Paul Smith. But he later explained he never felt like a Steven. According to friends, he started to go by Elliott because "Steve" sounded too jock-ish but "Steven" sounded too pretentious. One biographer speculated that Smith gave himself the new name after the street he lived on in Portland, Elliott Avenue. But Elliott Smith is much more than a name.</p>

<p>Smith, after his song "Miss Misery" was nominated for Best Original Song in the 1998 Academy Awards, said he wasn't the right kind of person to be big and famous. This was true throughout his life. He had a troubled childhood. He and his stepdad didn't have the relationship he had hoped for. This childhood would eventually become the reason Smith numbed himself with drugs and alcohol later on in life.</p>

<p>He fell in love with music at a young age. Around 9 or 10, he started to play piano and acoustic guitar. He even wrote a song on piano called "Fantasy" at this age, and he took home a prize from the local arts festival thanks to his work. By the time Smith was 14 years old, he abandoned his childhood home and family in Texas with the hope of finding something that could make him happy somewhere else. He moved to Portland, Oregon, at only 14 years old.</p>

<p>When Smith got to Portland to live with his dad, he began to use drugs and alcohol. But he also began to record for the first time.</p>

<p>While attending Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts, in 1991, Smith formed a band called Heatmiser. The final album, Mic City Sons, was released only five years later.</p>

<p>Smith broke off into his own world of music after Heatmiser. He decided to send some of his songs to Cavity Search Records, after much convincing from his then-girlfriend. Smith said he thought his "head would be chopped off immediately" once it was released because it was the complete opposite kind of music than grunge, which was popular at this time around 1994.</p>

<p>The path from a quiet, shy and tortured artist with a small underground following did not end when Smith was picked by the director of "Good Will Hunting" to create part of the film's soundtrack. His obscurity didn't even end when his song "Miss Misery" was nominated for an Academy Award. Smith, looking calm and angelic in his white suit, sang on the stage in front of a room of famous actors and directors who had no idea who he was. But he didn't care. He said he wasn't nervous. He just wanted to share his music.</p>

<p>Smith's life ended tragically on Oct. 21, 2003 in Los Angeles, California. He was stabbed twice in the chest. To this day, no one is certain whether Smith died by suicide or at the hands of someone else. Many people think Smith's music is only dark, solemn and depressing. But his music is more than what it seems, just like his name.</p>

    <p>I created this page to share one of my favorite artists with people who may not be familiar with his work. I enjoy sharing him with people because he was not just a sad person or a drug addict or an alcoholic, which is often times how he is remembered. His music is filled with the ups and downs of life, not only the downs.</p>
    <p>If you'd like to learn more about Smith's life and music, read his background information <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Smith"> on Wikipedia.</a>
